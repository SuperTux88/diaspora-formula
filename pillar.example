#   tofs:
#     The files_switch key serves as a selector for alternative
#     directories under the formula files directory. See TOFS pattern
#     doc for more info.
#     Note: Any value not evaluated by `config.get` will be used literally.
#     This can be used to set custom paths, as many levels deep as required.
#     files_switch:
#       - any/path/can/be/used/here
#       - id
#       - roles
#       - osfinger
#       - os
#       - os_family
#
#     All aspects of path/file resolution are customisable using the options below.
#     This is unnecessary in most cases; there are sensible defaults.
#     Default path: salt://< path_prefix >/< dirs.files >/< dirs.default >
#             I.e.: salt://diaspora/files/default
#     path_prefix: template_alt
#     dirs:
#       files: files_alt
#       default: default_alt
#
#     The entries under `source_files` are prepended to the default source files
#     given for the state
#     source_files:
#       web_service:
#         - 'diaspora-puma.service'
